# Golf Application AS .Net Core Console Application

## Assignment

Your assignment is to make a golf game. In the application, the user controls a golf player trying to get a golf ball to the cup at the end of a course.
You do this by selecting the angle of the ball’s trajectory, and the force you put behind the swing. The game ends when the ball is in the cup.

## Requirments

### Features:

- The player should be able to launch the golf ball from its initial location, with a given angle (degrees from the ground up) and velocity (m/s at the start of the ball’s arc).
- The angle and velocity should determine how far the ball travels, reducing the distance between the starting location and the cup.
- Each swing should move the starting location for each arc.
- Gravity should affect the ball while it travels, which should be used to determine the arc of the ball.
- The progress the player makes should be displayed between swings, showing the amount of swings the player has taken, as well as the distance to the cup.
- If the ball travels beyond the cup, the new distance should still be positive.
- When the ball has reached the goal, the game should end, displaying all swings taken, and how far the ball travelled each time.
- If the ball moves too far away from the cup, the game should generate an exception that takes you out of the game loop, with a failure message.
- If too many swings have been taken, the game should end, with a different failure message.

### Algorithms:

- Angle In Radians: (Math.PI / 180) * angle
- Distance: Math.Pow(velocity, 2) / GRAVITY * Math.Sin(2 * angleInRadians)
- Gravity is equal to 9.8
- Example: At 45 Degrees and 56 m/s, the ball should travel 320 meters.
